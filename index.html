                                Everything here is a guide and not pure science, these things will not always work. I
                                recommend always checking at least 2 different indicators as they often consider different things.
                                One
                                might be telling you it’s a good time to buy where another could be indicating the opposite.

                            <p>
                                From one candle along you can see the volume in relation to the candles around it, the Open, Close, High and Low for it's time frame.
                                It can be very helpful to see prices that were temporarily reached but then reversed.
                                this
                                There are many (probably hundreds) of candlestick patterns that can be an indication or confirmation of future price movements.

                                Trends:
                                Try to draw a line touching the top of at least 3 candles for down trend (the bottom for up trend), the
                                more
                                candles the line touches the stronger the trend. This is a simple way to see if there is a change in
                                trend
                                (A candle breaks through the line by more than a little bit and closes there)
                            </p>
                        </div>

                            <p>
                                Draw the trend line above and below and see where they come together.
                                Depending on the shape and slant it might mean a bullish or bearish breakout but either way at the point you can expect a bigger move.
                                (I don’t find this reliable on it’s own and usually combine it with the RSI or another indicator to to confirm)
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Right-Angled triangles seem to be the most reliable indication of a move.
                                If the Hypotenuse is above the price it's known as a descending triangle and will usually lead to a downward move.
                                The opposite goes for Ascending triangles which have a 60-70% chance of breaking to the upside.

                                There are a lot of rules about Elliot Wave; but to over simplify things the markets main trend is a series of 5 waves.
                                (Waves 1, 3 and 5 are the bigger waves in the direction of the trend while 2 & 4 are smaller counter trend moves)
                                Other important take-aways are that wave 3 is usually the longest but cannot be the shortest wave.

                                This Bearish pattern signals a trend reversal and can be described as
                                a zig zag that forms a high, followed by another higher high
                                followed by a lower high roughly resembling the shape of a head.

                                below 30 is oversold and above 70 is overbought.

            <h4>Trade Volume:</h4>
            <p>
                We aint going to the moon if there’s not much volume… also ain’t going to crash to little volume means a
                sideways movement at least for the short term.
            </p>

            <h4>Bollinger Bands:</h4>
            <p>
                These show the volatility and likely price movements, they lag a little (if there’s a sudden spike the
                band
                will take a candle or two to adjust) I try to play with these when there’s a sideways movement as the
                top
                middle line and bottom of the bands act as support and resistance. With this you can enter trades at the
                bottom of a band and know you should sell between the middle or top.
            </p>


            <h4>Previous Regions of support or resistance:</h4>
            <p>
                The past tends to repeat itself. If you look at any chart you will see that a lot of price ranges that
                were
                not broken on the first attempt later become support and don’t immediately get passed when the trend
                change
                direction. This is expecially true for numbers that have a psychological affect eg big even’s 1000, 5000
                10000 etc… maybe smaller numbers depending on timeframes.
            </p>

            <h4>Fibonacci retracements:</h4>
            <p>
                Fibonacci is everywhere in trading, you will find the fib levels on trading tools tend to line up with
                previous support and big whole numbers. When I say level or number I mean a rang not an exact number.
                The
                most important fib ratios in crypto are usually 0.768, 0.618, 0.382 and 1.618 extension
