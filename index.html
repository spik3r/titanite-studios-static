        <h3 class="title">Technical Analysis Basics:</h3>
        <p>In finance, technical analysis is an analysis methodology
            for forecasting the direction of prices through the study
            of past market data, primarily price and volume.
        </p>

        <h4>Nothing is certain:</h4>
        <p>
            Everything here is a guide and not pure science, these things work most of the time but not always. I
            recommend always checking at least 2 different indicators as they somethings consider different things one
            might be telling you it’s a good time to buy where another could be the opposite.
            Candles:
            Use candles please DON’T use the line graph :) Candles tell you sooo much more, the volume, the start and
            end of that time frame, any outliers (places it might have reached but then reversed). In addition to this
            there are many (probably hundreds) of candlestick patterns and they also help with everything else I’m going
            to write here.
            Trends:
            Try to draw a line touching the top of at least 3 candles for down trend (the bottom for up trend), the more
            candles the line touches the stronger the trend. This is a simple way to see if there is a change in trend
            (A candle breaks through the line by more than a little bit)
        </p>
        <h4>Wedges:</h4>
        <p>
            Draw the trend line above and below and see where they come together. Depending on the shape it might mean
            different things but either way at the point you can expect a bigger move. (I don’t find this reliable on
            it’s own and usually combine it with the RSI or another indicator to decide which way I think it will go)
        </p>
        <h4>Elliot wave:</h4>
        <p>
            http://stockcharts.com/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:market_analysis:elliott_wave_theory
            Basically this is a method of counting the patterns to form a zig zag like pattern either up or down. There
            are a lot of rules about wave numbers the sizes they have to each other etc so it’s fairly complicated
            compared to the others to fully understand. Oversimplified you try and make 5 points and usually the
            distance from point 3 -> 4 is the biggest.
        </p>

        <h4>Head & Shoulders pattern:</h4>
        <p>
            Like Elliot Wave except you draw one extra line points 2 and 5 are the shoulders and point 4 is the head.
            This pattern signals a trend reversal
        </p>
        <h4>RSI:</h4>
        <p>
            RSI tells us if something is overbought (about to correct) or oversold(about to moon). Again oversimplified
            it’s the distance of the current price from the moving average price. The normal price range is from 30-70
            below 30 is oversold and above 70 is overbought.
        </p>

        <h4>Trade Volume:</h4>
        <p>
            We aint going to the moon if there’s not much volume… also ain’t going to crash to little volume means a
            sideways movement at least for the short term.
        </p>

        <h4>Bollinger Bands:</h4>
        <p>
            These show the volatility and likely price movements, they lag a little (if there’s a sudden spike the band
            will take a candle or two to adjust) I try to play with these when there’s a sideways movement as the top
            middle line and bottom of the bands act as support and resistance. With this you can enter trades at the
            bottom of a band and know you should sell between the middle or top.
        </p>

        <h4>Moving Averages:</h4>
        <p>
            Tell you the average movement of the last x bars.
            Buy signal: when shorter (faster ema) crosses over and ends up higher than the bigger (slower ema)
            Sell signal: when shorter (faster ema) crosses over and ends up lower than the bigger (slower ema)
        </p>

        <h4>Previous Regions of support or resistance:</h4>
        <p>
            The past tends to repeat itself. If you look at any chart you will see that a lot of price ranges that were
            not broken on the first attempt later become support and don’t immediately get passed when the trend change
            direction. This is expecially true for numbers that have a psychological affect eg big even’s 1000, 5000
            10000 etc… maybe smaller numbers depending on timeframes.
        </p>

        <h4>Fibonacci retracements:</h4>
        <p>
            Fibonacci is everywhere in trading, you will find the fib levels on trading tools tend to line up with
            previous support and big whole numbers. When I say level or number I mean a rang not an exact number. The
            most important fib ratios in crypto are usually 0.768, 0.618, 0.382 and 1.618 extension
        </p>
